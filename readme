This is a fraud credit card detection project using several methods of anomaly detection from SK lean package with the help of local outlier factor to calculate anomaly scores as well as an isolation force algorithm. These two algorithms will come through our dataset of almost 280,000 credit card transactions and predict which ones are fraudulent.In our dataset we have 30 parameters, having the time and the amount of the transaction as well as 28 other features that are a result of PCA dimensionality reduction in order to protect the identity and sensitive information involved with these credit card transactions. Here 1 represents fraudulent transaction whereas 0 represents valid transaction with -1 for outlier or a value of 1 as an inlier
